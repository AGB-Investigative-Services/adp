I have always dressed within company policy, but when I started with Procurement, she spoke with me and said how I should dress business professional more within this position, which is what I did. But, at the end of her statement she said ""Professionalism is key esp when attending meetings."" Even though this was just a statement, it is an indication that I do not dress professional when attending meetings and I definitely do. Always! So, this comment left me with some slight confusion.

She is actively pursuing work on local, state and federal level. She is gainfully employed in regards to ensuring the Procurement goals are met."" However, the truth is I have exceeded this goal. I was pushing out beyond the number of opportunities I was supposed to find, and she ask me to ""slow down, because she couldn't keep up"". This is understandable because a personalized proposal must be sent out for each opportunity. However, I should be graded on the reality of the work that I was putting out, not just the amount of work that she requested for me to complete. She also stated she ""would love for me to take a writing class"" but to my knowledge nothing is wrong with my writing skills, nor has she ever pulled me to the side to address any errors.
